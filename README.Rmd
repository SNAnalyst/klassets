The `{klassets}` package is a collection of functions to simulate data sets to:

- Teach how some Statistics Models and Machine Learning algorithms works.
- Illustrate certain some particular events such as heteroskedasticity or the Simpson's paradox.
- Compare the predictions between modelos, for example logistic regression vs decision tree vs $k$-Nearest Neighbours.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/animation_quasi_anscombre.gif")
```

# Some examples

## Don't forget to visualize the data

```{r}
library(klassets)

set.seed(123)

df <- sim_quasianscombe_set_1(beta0 = 3, beta1 = 0.5)

plot(df) +
  ggplot2::labs(subtitle = "Very similar to the given parameters (3 and 0.5)")
```

```{r}
library(patchwork)

df2 <- sim_quasianscombe_set_2(df, fun = sin)
df6 <- sim_quasianscombe_set_6(df, groups = 2, b1_factor = -1)

plot(df2) + plot(df6)
```

## Compare models in a classifications task

```{r}
df <- sim_response_xy(relationship = function(x, y) sin(x*pi) > sin(y*pi))

df

plot(df)
```

You can fit differents models and see how the predictions are made.

```{r, out.width = "100%"}
plot(fit_logistic_regression(df, order = 4)) +
plot(fit_classification_tree(df))            +
plot(fit_classification_random_forest(df))   +
plot(fit_knn(df))                            +
  plot_layout(guides = "collect")
```

## How $K$-means works

Another example of what can be done with `{klassets}`.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/animation_kmeans_iterations.gif")
```

## Where to start

You can check:

- `vignette("Quasi-Anscombe-data-sets")` to know more about `sim_quasianscombe_set*` functions family.
- `vignette("Binary-classification")`/`vignette("Regression")` to see classifiers/regression models/methods.
- `vignette("Clustering")` to see clustering functions.
- `vignette("MNIST")` to work with this data set to compare models and check
some variable importance metrics.

## Installation

You can install the development version of klassets from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("jbkunst/klassets")
```
## Extra Info(?!)

**Why the name Klassets?** Just a weird merge for Class/Klass and sets.
